## Instruction for near wall variable extraction ##
You're advised to install package UTIL to your local python compiler, by runing the following,
cd <path to util>
cd util
. forge.sh
And you would be able to proceed.

If you are dealing with a FLUENT data file, which has unstructured format, you'll have to rebuild the unstructured data into a structured one, by doing the following,
vi structured_builder.py
And modify a few parameters, mainly the directories/filenames of your input/output.eg.
dir_in
filename_out_grid ## where structured grid is generated
filename_out_data ## where structured data is generated
filename_out_vis  ## where visualization file is generated
...
Details are enclosed in the python code.


Execute the python code. If you receive no warnings nor errors, you can now proceed to the next stage to extract the profiles.

Make a few changes to extract_profiles.py mainly the directories/filenames of your input/output.
dir_in
filename_in_grid
filename_in_data

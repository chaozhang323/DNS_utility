# DNS_utility
Pre-/post-processing code for direct numerical simulation code.

## 2decomp_fft
1. General-purpose 2D pencil decomposition & FFT library to support building large-scale parallel applications on distribution memory systems.
2. Highly scalable and efficient distributed Fast Fourier Transform module, supporting three dimensional FFTs (both complex-to-complex and real-to-complex/complex-to-real).
3. Halo-cell support allowing explicit message passing between neighbouring blocks.
4. Parallel I/O module to support the handling of large data sets.
5. Shared-memory optimisation on the communication code for multi-code systems.
6. Interface with most popular external FFT libraries.
